# PythonRssFeedParser
PYTHON GUI FOR DOWNLOADING AND PARSING RSS FEED USING 'feedparser' LIBRARY

feedparser - Universal Feed Parser is a Python module for downloading and parsing syndicated feeds. It parses several popular extension modules, including Dublin Core and Appleâ€™s iTunes extensions.

It is not meant to run standalone; it is a module to be used as part of larger Python program. Universal Feed Parser is easy to use; the module is self-contained in a single file, feedparser.py, and it has one primary public function, parse. parse takes a number of arguments, but only one is required, and it can be a URL, a raw string.

## The module can be installed using the command - pip install feedparser
